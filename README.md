My Github account is set as default since I did not select any programs I wanted to use since I wasn't sure which ones would be needed or useful.

This repository only contains this information listed here and is otherwise default as a newly created repository.

I downloaded Github Desktop and signed into my Github account. Once logged in, I chose this new repository that I created and cloned it to a folder within Finder.
